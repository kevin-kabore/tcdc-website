			<div class="copy-ctn">
				<p>In the late 1990s, in an effort to even better serve the community, San Francisco’s Mayor, the Honorable Willie L. Brown Jr. called together five of San Francisco’s most prominent African American ministers and asked them to join forces to address community economic development. As a result, Tabernacle Community Development Corporation was incorporated in 2001 and on January 14, 2002 was granted tax-exempt status becoming a 501c-3 organization. Today TCDC is located in San Francisco’s Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood and the five original founders serve on the Board of Directors along with other professionals.</p>

				<p>The organizations initial focus was economic development, youth education, and job skill training for unemployed and re-entry members of the community. In the first five years of existence TCDC successfully executed multiple education and program services.  In 2007, after much prayer, deliberation, and research these five community stakeholders strategically decided to focus on building affordable housing units as a mechanism to help pay for program services. However, the primary objective is developing affordable rental units is to keep black families from leaving San Francisco and to build homes for sale that will increase ownership within the African American community. Today, with an enduring mission to direct positive economic and societal changes in underserved communities where their churches are located, the founders continue to leverage resources, build important community relationships, and create various partnerships, through shared efforts and joint ventures.</p>

				<p>Collectively, the churches have an impressive history developing low cost housing programs, homeownership initiatives, senior housing, and addressing homeless issues. Individually, each minister has significant experience with affordable housing development, the five parishes currently own and sponsor over 1,000 units of low income and senior housing.</p>
